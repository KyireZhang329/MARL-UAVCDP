# MARL-UAVCDP
This repository is about the project of the Cooperative Decision-Making and Path Planning for UAV Swarm based on the Multi-Agent Reinforcement learning.  

This project, which I followed the lecturer [Li qingyang](https://faculty.xidian.edu.cn/LQY1/zh_CN/index.htm) at the School of Computer Science and Technology in Xidian University to research, is the first research project that I have been involved in since I started university.
